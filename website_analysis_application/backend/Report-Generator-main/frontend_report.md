### 2) Key Technical Issues  

#### Structural HTML Errors  
- Lack of semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, and `<section>`, which impairs accessibility and SEO optimization.  
- Buttons lack accessible names or labels, rendering them unusable for screen readers.  
- Missing `<meta name="viewport">` tag compromises mobile responsiveness.  
- Absence of `<nav>` elements or ARIA landmark roles, which limits structured navigation.  

#### Accessibility Non-Compliance  
- Buttons without accessible names hinder usability for assistive technologies.  
- No ARIA landmarks or roles for screen reader navigation.  
- Lack of mechanisms (e.g., skip links) to bypass repetitive content.  

#### Performance Bottlenecks  
- Render-blocking resources delay the first paint of the page.  
- Static assets lack long cache lifetimes, potentially impacting repeat visit performance.  

#### CSS/JavaScript Efficiency  
- No significant inefficiencies detected; CSS and JavaScript are optimized for delivery. However, responsive CSS could improve layout adaptability across devices.

### 3) Prioritized Action Plan  

#### High Priority (Accessibility and Semantics)  
1. **Enhance HTML Structure**:  
   - Add semantic elements `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>` to improve accessibility and SEO.  
   - Use the `<lang>` attribute in the `<html>` tag to specify the pageâ€™s language.  

2. **Improve Accessibility**:  
   - Assign discernible labels to buttons using `aria-label` or visible text.  
   - Define ARIA landmarks and roles (e.g., `role="navigation"`) for better screen reader navigation.  
   - Implement skip links or other mechanisms to allow users to bypass repetitive content.  

#### Medium Priority (Performance Optimization)  
3. **Address Render-Blocking Resources**:  
   - Inline critical CSS to reduce rendering delays.  
   - Defer non-critical JavaScript to improve load times.  

4. **Optimize Caching**:  
   - Serve static assets with a long cache lifetime to enhance performance for repeat visitors.  

#### Low Priority (Mobile and Responsiveness)  
5. **Optimize for Mobile**:  
   - Add `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` to improve mobile responsiveness.  
   - Create responsive CSS to ensure a consistent experience across various screen sizes.
